This website is dedicated to the tutorials for the collaborators of the grant Precision Brain Mapping [2023 - 2027]

The project 'Precision mapping of electrical brain network dynamics with application to epilepsy' is a multidisciplinary sinergia consortium focused on multimodal imaging (diffusion MRI, intracranial and scalp EEG) with advanced signal processing and graph theory methods

This repository gathers tutorials helpful internally for the SINERGIA consortium and the success of the different workpackages of the project. 

Here you can find different tutorials to support the FAIRness of the data and the Open Science aspects of the different workpackages of the SINERGIA project.
