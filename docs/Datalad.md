# DATALAD ON UNIL STORAGE

[Datalad](https://www.datalad.org/) is an open-source data management solution based on Git and Git-Annex.


Because of the restricitions related to the storage of sensitive data imposed by UNIL, it is unfortunately no possible yet to implement DataLad on Urblauna.
However, DataLad should be used for data provenance and tracking of all the data stored on Curnagl.
