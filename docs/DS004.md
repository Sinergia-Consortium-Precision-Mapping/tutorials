# DS004 - Prospective Dataset SINERGIA

## Recruitment

Objective Cohort ​
- 40 healthy participants        --  target: 20 first ctrl by the summer 2024 ~ 5/month​
- 40 patients with epilepsy      --  target: 2/month ~ 2 years total

The approximate rythm for acquisition will be around ~2 patients par month. 

Recruitment of controls​
- via  personal networks and flyers posted in HUG, UNIGE, CHUV, and a few other places.​
- The flyer is stored on the One Drive UNIGE shared between the acquisition team and on the SINERGIA switchdrive (Switchdrive UNIL will end by June 2024).​
- All the potential control participants are sent to LDW, who send them the email with the information and MRI contraindication. ​

- We preferably recruit French speaker people because of all the documents provided in French. ​

Recruitment of patients​
Screened and sent by SV during the clinical appointments


## Preparation and Acquisition

For controls:​
1. LDW sends  the template email with the explanation, contra-indications MRI and convocation​
2. Welcome the participant in Biotech ​
3. Consent Form Signature, available in the OneDrive​
4. EEG or MRI protocol first depending on the availabilities​
5. Compensation of 60CHF given in cash after signature of the receipt form (also in OneDrive).


For patients:​
1. Phone contact after redirection of the patient by Serge to the research team​
2. Welcome the participant in Biotech ​
3. Consent Form Signature, available in the OneDrive​
4. EEG or MRI protocol first depending on the availabilities​
5. Compensation based on their travel receipts and cost of lunch covered (if full day acquisition).​

Recruitment tries to be optimized to have always 2 participants on the same day to do MRI and EEG sessions in parallel and then invert

Storage of the documents​:
The payment of the controls is done by cash by EM, withdrawn in advance by PH from the SINERGIA grant​
All the templates of the mentioned documents are available on the One Drive UNIG and SINERGIA switchdrive ​
Ethics are available in these shared spaces.​
All the signed original documents are stored, scanned and stored carto1000 and physically in HUG.


## Protocol

EEG
The document ‘Procedure d’enregistrement’ summarizes all the different steps for the recording​
Recordings are performed always with minimum 2 people among the persons formed (LDW, IR, EM).​
3 recordings are performed in this order:​
- Resting-state, eyes open (~ 10 min)​
- Auditory Task (~ 7 min)​
- Visual Task (~ 3 x 8 min  ~ 25 min)

MRI​
Recordings are performed always with minimum 2 persons: one of the MRI operators of the CIBM platform and SA or in replacement, LDW, IR, EM​
The sequences performed in this order:​
- MP2RAGE acquisition ​
- Resting-state BOLD fMRI (with physiological recordings)​
- Break (optional, mainly for patients)​
- Diffusion MRI​
- Diffusion multi-TE sequence 



## Data Exports and Storage of raw data

### EEG

Export​

During recording, data are locally stored on the EGI recording computer (without internet access) and transferred locally on a USB stick to the data transfer computer in the CIBM facility on the UNIGE drive.​
​
Storage​

Raw data are stored on carto1000 and uploaded on Urblauna, UNIL storage space for sensitive data. ​
BIDS dataset with LDW preprocessing are uploaded on Curnagl for sharing with the SINERGIA consortium.​
(see slides Storage of Raw Data & Storage of BIDS Data)



### MRI

Export​

Data are pushed to the DICOMS hub by the MRI operator.​
They are retrieved from the PACS computer in PEP3 Lausanne by YA with SA and/or EM and the DICOMS are directly uploaded in the RAW_DATA folder on Urblauna. ​

​
Storage​

Raw data are stored on Urblauna.​
Data are uploaded in BIDS format in the SINERGIA BIDS dataset on Curnagl.​
(see slides Storage of Raw Data & Storage of BIDS Data)


### Physiological signals
(?)



## Anonymization and Demographic Information

Participant Code​
Each subject has a code attributed.​
The first participant control gets the code following this model sub-ctrl01​
The first patient gets the code sub-01.​
The following participants are coded similarly using this model.​
The key code (name/identification code) is saved on CARTO1000 file protected in HUG​


Demographic Information​
The demographic information (age, handness, gender) are stored with the dataset on Curnagl.​
For the participants, the following demographic information are collected:​
Gender, age, handness, group(patient/control), lateralization(patients), level of educations (higher study- university, high school, before high school),  ​
​
Anonymization​
For EEG data, no other particular anonymization is required​
For MRI data, anonymazation (for example date of birth in the DICOM header) is performed during the BIDS conversion.  And PyFace??? Defacing ?​

​



## BIDS conversion

### For EEG

Conversion by LDW​

Matlab code​
Matlab coded is stored  on github 


### For MRI
Conversion by EM.​
Conversion in BIDS is done using heudiconv tool and the python file SINERGIA7T_heuristic.py (anonymization performed with the same tool). Stored on github sinergia ​
​
In parallel, data are stored on flywheel. ​
The DICOMS are directly uploaded via fw CLI and the gear rules automatically convert them into BIDS.
