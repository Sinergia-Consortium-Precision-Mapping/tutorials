# DS004 - Prospective Dataset SINERGIA

## Procedure of recruitment

Target: 40 healthy controls and 40 patients.

The patients are recruited by Serge during their clinical evaluation. Proposition of participation in the research protocol.

When a healthy participant is recruited, an email is sent to him with the explanation of the sessions and the MRI contra-indications form for making sure that the participant can actually perform the MRI.



## Protocol

The participant comes to Biotech and fills the consent form when he arrives. (The consent form is available for all the persons involved in the acquisition process on the group switchdrive).

MRI session is a 7T MRI session in Campus Biotech.
EEG is EEG session with EGI system in Campus Biotech as well. 

MRI sessions includes different protocols: MP2RAGE, resting-state functional MRI, diffusion MRI and multi-TE.
If it is tolerated by the participant, the physiological signals of the participant (respiration, heart rate) will be also recorded. The MRI session always happen with one MRI operator and one member of the acquisition team of the SINERGIA project (by default, SA and if not available, EM, IR or LDW).


Storage of consent forms? (and other documents).
Storage of the key ID. 




## Upload the data

### EEG
EEG data are directly anonymized at the recording step during the acquisition.
The EEG data are transfered manually from the local EGI computer (with no internet access) to a USB stick.
From a computer dedicated to data transfer in Campus Biotech, the data are uploaded in a cloud space provided by Campus Biotech/UNIGE (?).
The data are converted locally into BIDS format by LDW via a matlab code 'data2bids.m'.
BIDS data are uploaded on Curnagl by (LDW?) in the DS004
For now, the EEG data are not uploaded on Flywheel. 

### MRI
MRI data are collected on the 7T MRI in Biotech. The data are pushed by the MRI operator on DICOMS hubs to be accessible from CHUV. In PEP3, Lausanne office, the data are retrieved from the computer connected to the PACS by YA. They are uploaded directly from the PACS computer to URBLAUNA in the raw data directory ().
Data are then anonymized (Defacing also (?)) by EM(?) and converted into BIDS using heudiconv. 
The anonymized BIDS data are uploaded on Curnagl in DS004 directory (path: '/work/PRTNR/CHUV/RADMED/phagmann/sinergia2norm').
In parallel, the DICOMS are uploaded to Flywheel and converted using Flywheel Gears (BIDS pre-curation and BIDS curation).
