For any question regarding this tutorial, please contact emeline.mullier@chuv.ch


A storage space has been created on the UNIL server to store the data of the SINERGIA project so every member can easily access them for their analyses.


## General information about UNIL Clusters
UNIL has 2 clusters called respectively Curnagl and Urblauna. 
Curnagl is the regular cluster while Urblauna is dedicated to sensitive data and accordingly has more restrictions.

For our data, we have storage space on Urblauna, the cluster for sensitive data.
UNIL cluster is called Urblauna and information about its infrastructure can be found here:  
https://wiki.unil.ch/ci/books/high-performance-computing-hpc/page/urblauna



## Getting the access to the cluster
The complete procedure to get access to UNIL cluster is generally described in the UNIL wiki on this page:  
https://wiki.unil.ch/ci/books/high-performance-computing-hpc/page/how-to-access-the-clusters

More specifically, in the context on our SINERGIA project, the steps you will have to follow are the following:
<ol>
  <li> If you don't have one, create a UNIL account </li>
  You can follow this procedure : https://wiki.unil.ch/ci/books/high-performance-computing-hpc/page/providing-access-to-external-collaborators
  <ul>
    <li> Create your EduID via www.eduid.ch. If you are part of a swiss university, you probably already have it and you can use your current one. If you are external to any swiss university, you can create one with any email adress. </li>
    <li> Fill <a href="https://wayf.switch.ch/SWITCHaai/WAYF?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fprdlamp2.unil.ch%2Fshibboleth&return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.unil.ch%2FShibboleth.sso%2FLogin%3FSAMLDS%3D1%26target%3Dss%253Amem%253A7f5a2e2091957a748dac804d49fef21f75beae737de1717e0876f6abde37ce30"> the form </a> for the creation of the UNIL IT account:  </li>
