A storage space has been created on the UNIL server to store the data of the SINERGIA project so every member can easily access them for their analyses.

## UNIL Clusters
UNIL has 2 clusters called respectively Curnagl and Urblauna. 
Curnagl is the regular cluster while Urblauna is dedicated to sensitive data and accordingly has more restrictions.

For our data, we have storage space on Urblauna, the cluster for sensitive data.
UNIL cluster is called Urblauna and information about its infrastructure can be found here:

## Getting the access to the cluster
The complete procedure to get access to UNIL cluster is generally described in the UNIL wiki on this page:  
https://wiki.unil.ch/ci/books/high-performance-computing-hpc/page/how-to-access-the-clusters

To be able to access the UNIL cluster and storage space, you need to have an UNIL username.
